About
=============================
libghp is a collection of libraries for developing multimedia
applications in C++.  This is very well-trodden ground.  Our objective
is to produce a really _slick_ library in the tradition of Boost and the
STL.

Required Libraries
=============================

GL, GLU, GLEW
SDL
Boost

n.b. if you're not using the default Makefiles, be sure to mimic them as
much as possible.  In particular, be sure that your compiler is set to 

Coding Style
=============================
- 2 space tabs
- C++-style casts
- lowercase_with_underscores.  Think STL.
- Class members suffixed with underscore_
- RAII is king!  Throw exceptions from constructors on failure to init.

Just look at the rest of the code and try to imitate it :-)
